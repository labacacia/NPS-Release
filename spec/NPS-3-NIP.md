# NPS-3: Neural Identity Protocol (NIP)

**Spec Number**: NPS-3
**Status**: Proposed
**Version**: 0.10
**Date**: 2026-05-11
**Port**: 17433 (default, shared) / 17435 (optional dedicated)
**Authors**: Ori Lynn / INNO LOTUS PTY LTD
**Depends-On**: NPS-1 (NCP v0.8)

---

## 1. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

---

## 2. Protocol Overview

NIP issues a verifiable Neural Identity (NID) to every AI agent, NWP node, and human operator, carrying capability declarations and scope-bound permissions. It supports trust-chain propagation and real-time revocation. NIP is the heart of the NPS security model.

### 2.1 Actors

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Root CA | Root certificate authority; stored offline |
| Org CA | Organization intermediate CA; one per organization |
| Agent | AI agent holding an NID certificate |
| Node | NWP node holding an NID certificate |
| Operator | Human administrator holding an Operator certificate |
| Verifier | The party verifying an NID (usually a Node) |

### 2.2 CA Hierarchy

```
Root CA (offline, rarely used)
    │
    └── Org Intermediate CA (one per org, 1-year validity)
            ├── Agent Certificate    (30-day validity, auto-renewal supported)
            ├── Node Certificate     (90-day validity)
            └── Operator Certificate (1-year validity, bound to MFA)
```

---

## 3. NID Format

```abnf
nid           = "urn:nps:" entity-type ":" issuer-domain ":" identifier
entity-type   = "agent" / "node" / "org"
issuer-domain = <RFC 1034 domain>
identifier    = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / ".")
```

**Examples**

```
urn:nps:agent:ca.innolotus.com:550e8400-e29b-41d4    ← AI agent
urn:nps:node:api.myapp.com:products                   ← NWP node
urn:nps:org:mycompany.com                              ← Organization CA
```

### 3.1 Reserved identifier prefixes (NPS-CR-0003)

Two identifier prefixes are reserved on NIDs of `entity-type = agent` and signal a structural role within the orchestrator / session lineage model. Both follow the existing identifier ABNF (`1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / ".")`).

| Prefix | Role | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `group-` | Orchestrator group NID — the trust anchor for a fleet of session NIDs issued by the CA on the group's behalf. Longer-lived (default 365 days) and revocable. | `urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:group-7f3c9e1a-b2d8-4c6f-9a01` |
| `session-` | Short-lived session NID issued under a group. The portion after `session-` MUST be of the form `{unix-timestamp}-{random}` where `{random}` is at least 8 hex characters. Default validity 1 hour, max 24 hours. | `urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:session-1714672800-f3a92c0b` |

Identifiers without these prefixes continue to behave as ordinary agent NIDs. Receivers MUST NOT reject a NID solely on its prefix; the prefix is informational and the authoritative role is carried in the signed `IdentFrame.lineage.role` field (§5.1.3). The protocol-level `nop:orchestrate` capability (NPS-5) continues to express the *role* of being an orchestrator and is independent of this prefix convention.

---

## 4. Signature Algorithms

| Algorithm | Use | Key length |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Ed25519** (primary) | High-frequency agent verification | 32-byte private key / 32-byte public key |
| **ECDSA P-256** (fallback) | Compatibility scenarios | 32-byte private key / 64-byte public key |

Public-key encoding: `{algorithm}:{base64url(DER)}`, e.g. `ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...`.

---

## 5. Frame Types

### 5.1 IdentFrame (0x20)

Agent identity declaration carrying the certificate. Sent as the handshake frame on every new connection.

**Field definitions**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `frame` | uint8 | required | Fixed value `0x20` |
| `nid` | string | required | Agent NID |
| `pub_key` | string | required | Public key; format `{alg}:{base64url}` |
| `capabilities` | array | required | Capabilities held by the agent |
| `scope` | object | required | Access-scope declaration |
| `issued_by` | string | required | Issuer NID (Org CA) |
| `issued_at` | string | required | Issue time (ISO 8601 UTC) |
| `expires_at` | string | required | Expiration time (ISO 8601 UTC) |
| `serial` | string | required | Certificate serial (globally unique per Org CA, hex) |
| `signature` | string | required | CA's signature over this frame; format `{alg}:{base64url}` |
| `cert_format` | string (enum) | required | Certificate encoding format. One of `"x509-der"` / `"raw-pubkey"`. Excluded from the signed canonical JSON (see §5.1.3 canonicalisation note). |
| `cert_chain` | array of string | required when `cert_format = "x509-der"` | DER-encoded certificate chain, base64url-encoded, leaf first. When `cert_format = "raw-pubkey"`, `cert_chain` MUST be omitted (not present in the serialised frame and not included in the canonical form). Excluded from the signed canonical JSON (see §5.1.3 canonicalisation note). |
| `metadata` | object | optional | Agent metadata — see below |
| `assurance_level` | string | optional | One of `"anonymous"` / `"attested"` / `"verified"` (see §5.1.1). REQUIRED when the NID's certificate carries the `id-nid-assurance-level` extension. Receivers MUST treat an absent field as `"anonymous"` (backward compatibility with v1.0-alpha.2 publishers). When both field and cert extension are present, they MUST carry the same value — **phase gate**: Phase 1–2 (current) enforcement is opt-in (SHOULD check, MAY enforce); starting Phase 3 flag day (see NPS-RFC-0003 §8.1) enforcement is MUST, violation returns `NIP-ASSURANCE-MISMATCH`. (NPS-RFC-0003) |
| `lineage` | object | optional | Signed lineage metadata. Present when the NID is an orchestrator group (`role = "group"`) or a short-lived session (`role = "session"`). See §5.1.3. (NPS-CR-0003) |
| `ocsp_staple` | string | optional | Base64url-encoded DER OCSP response stapled by the Agent at send time (NIP v0.9 §5.1.4). Receivers SHOULD verify the staple signature; an expired staple returns `NIP-OCSP-STAPLE-EXPIRED`. When absent, receivers MAY perform an online OCSP lookup per the `ocsp_url` declared in the NWM. |
| `node_roles` | array[string] | optional | Self-declared node-role tags, e.g. `["memory", "orchestrator"]` (NIP v0.10). Same vocabulary as NDP `AnnounceFrame.node_roles`. Phase 1–2: self-declared, informational. Phase 3 flag day: MUST match the `id-nps-node-roles` X.509 extension (`1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.2`); mismatch returns `NIP-CERT-NODE-ROLES-MISMATCH`. |

**`metadata` fields (optional)**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model_family` | string | Model-family identifier used by the agent, e.g. `"openai/gpt-4o"`, `"anthropic/claude-4"` |
| `tokenizer` | string | Tokenizer identifier used by the agent, e.g. `"cl100k_base"` |
| `runtime` | string | Agent runtime identifier, e.g. `"langchain/0.2"`, `"autogen/0.4"` |

The `metadata` field is not included in the signature computation; an agent MAY set it at runtime. Nodes use the `tokenizer` in `metadata` to perform CGN auto-matching (see [token-budget.md](./token-budget.md)).

**Trust boundary for unsigned `metadata` (normative — closes issue #39)**

Because `metadata` is outside the signature, every value inside it is **agent-supplied and unverified**. Nodes MUST NOT use any field of `IdentFrame.metadata` (including but not limited to `model_family`, `tokenizer`, and `runtime`) as input to:

1. **Billing or settlement** — actual CGN charged to a tenant or counted against a paid quota,
2. **Quota elevation** — granting a larger token budget, higher concurrency, or any rate-limit tier above the default,
3. **Reputation scoring** — any persisted trust signal that affects future routing or pricing,
4. **Security or authorization decisions** — admittance to capability-gated endpoints, policy bypasses, or assurance-level checks.

For these uses a Node MUST instead consume a **verified** signal — an attribute carried in the signed IdentFrame body, the X.509 NID certificate (NPS-RFC-0002 extensions), or a CA-attested side channel — or a Node-internal **observed** measurement. Treating unsigned metadata as authoritative is a conformance violation.

**Three-tier tokenizer trust model**

To make the boundary above operational for token accounting, NPS defines three distinct tokenizer signals. Implementations MUST keep them separable in code paths and logs.

| Tier | Source | Trust | Permitted uses |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|
| `declared_tokenizer` | Agent-supplied via `IdentFrame.metadata.tokenizer` or the `X-NWP-Tokenizer` request header. **Unsigned.** | Agent self-claim only. | **Estimation hints only**: shaping pre-flight CGN estimates, cache-key disambiguation, telemetry. MUST NOT drive billing, quota elevation, reputation, or security. |
| `verified_tokenizer` | CA-attested or platform-attested binding of a tokenizer identifier to the NID — e.g. an X.509 NID-cert extension, an AaaS-operator attestation under NPS-AaaS-Profile, or another signed channel agreed by the deployment. | Cryptographically verifiable. | Authoritative for policy, billing, quota tiers, and assurance-gated access. Settlement-grade flows MUST gate on this tier. |
| `observed_tokenizer_profile` | Node-side statistical or behavioral inference (e.g. byte-length distributions, response-shape fingerprinting, sampled re-tokenization). | Node-internal measurement. | Abuse detection, drift alerts, anomaly scoring, and inputs to a Node's own reputation engine. MUST NOT be exported to peers as a verified claim. |

When more than one tier is available the Node MUST prefer the highest-trust tier for any decision the boundary above restricts; lower tiers MAY be retained alongside for diagnostic comparison.

**Standard `capabilities` values**

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `nwp:query` | May query Memory Nodes |
| `nwp:action` | May invoke Action Nodes |
| `nwp:stream` | May receive StreamFrame responses |
| `ncp:stream` | May initiate NCP streaming |
| `nop:delegate` | May delegate subtasks to other agents |
| `nop:orchestrate` | May act as an orchestrator and emit TaskFrames |
| `topology:read` | May read Anchor Node topology data via reserved query types `topology.snapshot` / `topology.stream` (NPS-2 §12); Anchor Nodes MUST require this capability at Phase 1–2 per NPS-2 §12.4. Self-declared and signed at Phase 1–2; CA-attested role binding deferred to Phase 3 (RFC-0002 amendment). |

**`scope` field**

```json
{
  "nodes":            ["nwp://api.myapp.com/*"],
  "actions":          ["orders:read", "orders:create"],
  "max_token_budget": 50000
}
```

**Signature computation**

The signature is computed over the canonical JSON of the IdentFrame with the `signature` field removed (keys sorted alphabetically, no whitespace).

**Full example**

```json
{
  "frame": "0x20",
  "nid": "urn:nps:agent:ca.innolotus.com:550e8400-e29b-41d4",
  "pub_key": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "capabilities": ["nwp:query", "nwp:action", "ncp:stream"],
  "scope": {
    "nodes":            ["nwp://api.myapp.com/*"],
    "actions":          ["orders:read", "orders:create"],
    "max_token_budget": 50000
  },
  "issued_by":  "urn:nps:org:mycompany.com",
  "issued_at":  "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-05-10T00:00:00Z",
  "serial":     "0x0A3F9C",
  "signature":  "ed25519:3045022100..."
}
```

### 5.1.1 Assurance Levels (NPS-RFC-0003)

NPS defines three **assurance levels** an Agent identity may carry, modelled on NIST SP 800-63 IAL and CA/B Forum DV/OV/EV. The level travels in `IdentFrame.assurance_level` and is the source of truth for Node policy decisions (`NWM.min_assurance_level`); when X.509 NID certificates are in use (NPS-RFC-0002), the cert MUST also carry the `id-nid-assurance-level` extension and the two MUST agree — **phase gate**: enforcement is opt-in in Phase 1–2 (current); mandatory starting Phase 3 flag day (see NPS-RFC-0003 §8.1).

| Level | Enum value | Minimum CA criteria | Typical use |
|-------|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| L0 | `"anonymous"` | Self-signed, OR CA-signed without out-of-band identity binding | Hobbyist Agents, dev / test, free read-only endpoints |
| L1 | `"attested"` | NID signed by an RFC-0002-compliant CA; CA attests possession of the NID private key (e.g. ACME `agent-01` challenge); contact email or domain verified. The `id-nid-assurance-level` X.509 extension uses IANA-assigned OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.1`; the companion `id-nps-node-roles` extension uses `1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.2` (PEN 65715 assigned to LabAcacia 2026-05-08, NPS-CR-0004; see NPS-RFC-0002 §10 OQ-2). | Most production Agents; default rate-limit tier |
| L2 | `"verified"` | L1 criteria **plus** CA binds the operator's legal identity (corporate registration for org-NIDs, signed AaaS-operator attestation for hosted Agents) | Regulated integrations, paid premium tiers, contract-grade orchestration |

Default is `"anonymous"` — pre-RFC-0003 NIDs and any NID lacking the field are treated as L0. A Node demanding stricter levels declares `min_assurance_level` in its NWM (NPS-2 §4.1, §4.3).

The values are an **ordered enum**: `anonymous < attested < verified`. A request whose level is below the Node's required level MUST be rejected with `NWP-AUTH-ASSURANCE-TOO-LOW` (`NPS-AUTH-FORBIDDEN`).

**Forward compatibility**: An implementation receiving an `assurance_level` value not present in this enum MUST treat it as a protocol error and return `NIP-ASSURANCE-UNKNOWN` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`). Implementations MUST NOT silently demote an unknown value to `anonymous` — silent demotion would create a security loophole for future higher-assurance levels introduced by a later spec revision.

See [NPS-RFC-0003](rfcs/NPS-RFC-0003-agent-identity-assurance-levels.md) for full design rationale, including the X.509 critical-extension flip planned in coordination with NPS-RFC-0002.

---

### 5.1.2 Reputation Log Entry (NPS-RFC-0004)

> Companion to assurance levels (§5.1.1). Where `assurance_level` answers *"who is this Agent?"*, reputation log entries answer *"how has this NID behaved?"* — published as a Certificate-Transparency-style append-only log so that any party (Node, auditor, downstream operator) can reach the same evidence about the same NID without a pre-existing relationship with the publisher.

A reputation entry is a signed JSON object that an issuer (typically an AaaS Anchor Node, an auditor, or a CA) publishes against a `subject_nid` to record one observed behavioral incident. Entries are aggregated by **log operators** that maintain an append-only history; the wire format below is the entry shape itself, independent of any specific log operator's HTTP surface (see [NPS-RFC-0004 §4.3](rfcs/NPS-RFC-0004-nid-reputation-log.md) for the operator interface).

**Field definitions**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `v` | uint8 | required | Schema version. This document defines `1`. |
| `log_id` | string (NID) | required | NID of the log operator that appended (or will append) this entry. MAY equal `issuer_nid` for self-published entries. |
| `seq` | uint64 | required | Monotonically increasing per-`log_id` sequence number. Set by the log operator on append. |
| `timestamp` | string (RFC 3339 UTC) | required | Log operator's commit time. |
| `subject_nid` | string (NID) | required | The NID this entry is *about*. |
| `incident` | string (enum) | required | One of the values in §5.1.2.1, or a forward-compatible unknown value (receivers MUST preserve unknown values). |
| `severity` | string (enum) | required | One of `info` / `minor` / `moderate` / `major` / `critical`. |
| `window` | object | optional | `{ start: ISO 8601, end: ISO 8601 }` describing the observation window. |
| `observation` | object | optional | Free-form, machine-readable, per-incident-type detail (e.g. `{requests: 45000, threshold: 300}` for a rate-limit violation). |
| `evidence_ref` | string (URL) | optional | URL where richer evidence (logs, transcripts) lives. |
| `evidence_sha256` | string (hex) | optional | SHA-256 of the evidence blob; lets queriers detect tampering with the off-log evidence. |
| `issuer_nid` | string (NID) | required | NID of the party making the assertion. MAY equal `log_id`. |
| `signature` | string | required | `{alg}:{base64url}` Ed25519 signature by `issuer_nid`'s private key over the **entry minus `signature`**, canonicalised per RFC 8785 (JCS). Log operators verify this signature, then re-sign the full entry with their `log_id` key for the ordering commitment (dual-signature model). |

#### 5.1.2.1 Incident vocabulary (initial)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `cert-revoked` | CA revoked the `subject_nid`'s cert. |
| `rate-limit-violation` | Sustained violation of published rate limits. |
| `tos-violation` | Violated an AaaS Anchor Node's published terms. |
| `scraping-pattern` | Behavior matched scraper heuristics. |
| `payment-default` | CGN or fiat default on a committed transaction. |
| `contract-dispute` | Unresolved contractual breach on an async NOP task. |
| `impersonation-claim` | Third-party claim that `subject_nid` is impersonating them. |
| `positive-attestation` | Explicit positive signal (e.g. independent audit passed). |

Receivers MUST treat unknown `incident` values as opaque pass-through (forward compatibility); operator-side filters MAY ignore them. See [NPS-RFC-0004 §4.2](rfcs/NPS-RFC-0004-nid-reputation-log.md) for the long-form rationale.

**Errors**

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `NIP-REPUTATION-ENTRY-INVALID` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`) | Entry signature fails verification or canonical form is malformed. |
| `NIP-REPUTATION-LOG-UNREACHABLE` (`NPS-DOWNSTREAM-UNAVAILABLE`) | A log operator referenced by a Node's `reputation_policy` cannot be reached during admission evaluation. |
| `NWP-AUTH-REPUTATION-BLOCKED` (`NPS-AUTH-FORBIDDEN`) | Reputation policy matched a `reject_on` rule on the requesting `subject_nid`. (Defined in NPS-2 §6 — Anchor / Memory / Action / Complex / Bridge Nodes that opt in.) |

> Phase 1 of NPS-RFC-0004 standardises the entry wire format and the signature rule above; the Merkle-tree / Signed Tree Head / inclusion-proof surface (RFC 9162-style) and the operator HTTP API land in Phase 2 alongside the NDP discovery hint. See the RFC for the full phasing.

---

### 5.1.3 Lineage (NPS-CR-0003)

`IdentFrame.lineage` carries the signed parent-chain metadata that links a short-lived session NID back to its orchestrator group NID, and that records who owns / authorised the group. The trust chain is:

```
human owner  →  Operator key (§2.1)  →  orchestrator group NID  →  short-lived session NID
```

`lineage` is part of the **signed** canonical JSON of the IdentFrame (unlike `metadata`, which is excluded). Modifying any sub-field invalidates the CA signature — this is what makes the chain *verifiable* end-to-end: a Node admitting a session NID can prove that `lineage.parent_nid` was authoritatively asserted by the CA at issuance time, not retro-fitted on the wire.

**Field definitions**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `role` | enum (`"group"` / `"session"`) | required when `lineage` is present | Lineage role of this NID. |
| `parent_nid` | string (NID) | required when `role = "session"` | Immediate parent NID. For a 1-level chain (group → session), equals `group_nid`. |
| `group_nid` | string (NID) | required when `role = "session"` | Group NID at the root of the chain. Equals `parent_nid` for a 1-level chain; reserved for future deeper chains. |
| `session_id` | string | required when `role = "session"` | Stable id of this execution; matches the `session-...` portion of the NID identifier (§3.1). Echoes back so consumers can index without parsing the URN. |
| `purpose` | string (≤256 UTF-8 bytes) | optional | Free-form, human-readable label for what this execution is for, e.g. `"order-classification-job"`. |
| `owner_user_id` | string | optional | Stable identifier of the human owner this group is acting on behalf of (e.g. internal user UUID). SHOULD be set when `role = "group"` and the deployment knows the owner. |
| `owner_key_id` | string | optional | `kid` hint identifying the owner-key (Operator key, OIDC `sub`, hardware-token id) that authorised creation of the group. |

**Group-NID example**

```json
"lineage": {
  "role":          "group",
  "owner_user_id": "user-7f3c9e1a",
  "owner_key_id":  "op-kid-2026-04"
}
```

**Session-NID example**

```json
"lineage": {
  "role":          "session",
  "parent_nid":    "urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:group-7f3c9e1a-b2d8-4c6f-9a01",
  "group_nid":     "urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:group-7f3c9e1a-b2d8-4c6f-9a01",
  "session_id":    "session-1714672800-f3a92c0b",
  "purpose":       "data-extraction-job-42",
  "owner_user_id": "user-7f3c9e1a",
  "owner_key_id":  "op-kid-2026-04"
}
```

**Backward compatibility**: pre-CR-0003 publishers omit `lineage`; pre-CR-0003 verifiers that strict-canonicalise (sort + omit `signature` / `metadata` / `cert_format` / `cert_chain`) will drop unknown fields if their DTO does not carry them, in which case signature verification of a CR-0003 frame fails. New senders aware of CR-0003 produce CR-0003 frames; old verifiers MUST be upgraded to verify them. Ordinary agent NIDs without `lineage` continue to verify exactly bit-compatibly.

**Errors**

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `NIP-CA-GROUP-REVOKED` (`NPS-AUTH-FORBIDDEN`) | Cannot issue a session under a group that has been revoked. |
| `NIP-CA-PARENT-NOT-FOUND` (`NPS-CLIENT-NOT-FOUND`) | The `parent_nid` / group NID referenced by a session-issue request does not exist. |
| `NIP-CA-PARENT-NOT-GROUP` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-PARAM`) | The referenced parent NID exists but is not registered as `lineage.role = "group"`. |
| `NIP-CA-SESSION-VALIDITY-INVALID` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-PARAM`) | Requested session validity below 60 seconds or above the CA's configured maximum. |
| `NIP-CA-JWS-INVALID` (`NPS-AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED`) | Group-JWS authorisation on a session-issue request fails signature, header, or shape validation. |
| `NIP-CA-JWS-EXPIRED` (`NPS-AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED`) | Group-JWS `iat` outside the CA's clock-skew window (default ±5 minutes). |
| `NIP-CERT-PARENT-REVOKED` (`NPS-AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED`) | A session NID's parent / group NID is revoked or expired (chain check, §7 step 3a). |

See [NPS-CR-0003](cr/NPS-CR-0003-orchestrator-group-session-nids.md) for the full motivation, JWS shape, and migration impact.

### 5.1.4 OCSP Stapling (NIP v0.9)

An Agent MAY attach a pre-fetched OCSP response to the `ocsp_staple` field of its IdentFrame, enabling the receiving Node to verify certificate revocation status without a live OCSP round-trip.

**Verification rules (receiver)**

1. Decode `ocsp_staple` from base64url to obtain the DER-encoded `OCSPResponse`.
2. Verify the OCSP response signature against the issuing CA's certificate (extracted from `cert_chain` or the Node's local trust store).
3. Check `thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate`: if the current time is after `nextUpdate`, return `NIP-OCSP-STAPLE-EXPIRED`.
4. Check `certStatus` in `SingleResponse` for the certificate identified by `serial`. If `revoked`, return `NIP-CERT-REVOKED`.
5. A staple that passes all checks supersedes any cached revocation state for this serial; the Node SHOULD NOT make a live OCSP request.

When `ocsp_staple` is absent, the Node MAY perform an online OCSP lookup to the URL declared in `NWM.ocsp_url` (§4.1). This lookup is optional but RECOMMENDED for `"verified"` assurance level endpoints.

**X.509 OID Registry (NIP v0.9 — PEN 65715 arc)**

| OID | Name | ASN.1 type | Description |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|
| `1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.1` | `id-nid-assurance-level` | UTF8String | Agent assurance level (`anonymous` / `attested` / `verified`). CA MUST populate when issuing. |
| `1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.2` | `id-nps-node-roles` | SEQUENCE OF UTF8String | Role tags carried in `AnnounceFrame.node_roles` / `IdentFrame.node_roles`. CA SHOULD populate from the enrollment request. Phase 3 enforcement. |
| `1.3.6.1.4.1.65715.2.3` | `id-nps-capabilities` | SEQUENCE OF UTF8String | Capability strings (same vocabulary as `IdentFrame.capabilities`). CA MAY populate as a CA-attested alternative to the unsigned `capabilities` field. Phase 3. |

---

### 5.2 TrustFrame (0x21)

Cross-CA trust-chain propagation and capability grant (commercial feature, NPS Cloud). A TrustFrame lets one CA (the **grantor**) authorise another CA (the **grantee**) to issue IdentFrames whose `capabilities` are accepted by Nodes that already trust the grantor — without the grantee being added to each Node's `trusted_issuers` list. The grant is scoped to a capability subset and a set of `nwp://` URL patterns; it is verifiable end-to-end via the grantor's signature.

**Field definitions**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `frame` | uint8 | required | Fixed `0x21`. |
| `grantor_nid` | string (NID) | required | NID of the granting CA. MUST be in the verifying Node's `trusted_issuers` for the TrustFrame to take effect. |
| `grantee_ca` | string (NID) | required | NID of the receiving CA. IdentFrames whose `issued_by` equals `grantee_ca` are admitted under the grant. |
| `trust_scope` | array of string | required | Capability strings the trust covers. MUST be a subset of the standard `capabilities` enum defined in §5.1 (`nwp:query` / `nwp:action` / `nwp:stream` / `ncp:stream` / `nop:delegate` / `nop:orchestrate` / `topology:read`). A grantee MUST NOT issue downstream IdentFrames carrying capabilities outside this set. |
| `nodes` | array of string | required | `nwp://` URL patterns this trust applies to. `*` matches a single path segment; `**` matches multiple segments. Empty array means the grant covers no nodes (effectively inert). |
| `issued_at` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | required | Issuance time. |
| `expires_at` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | required | Expiry time. After this instant the frame MUST be rejected with `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-EXPIRED`. |
| `serial` | string (hex) | required | 16-character zero-padded hex serial number used for revocation tracking via RevokeFrame (§5.3). |
| `signer_nid` | string (NID) | required | NID whose private key signs this frame. MUST be either `grantor_nid` itself or an operator NID under `grantor_nid`. |
| `signature` | string | required | `{alg}:{base64url}` — `ed25519:` (Ed25519) or `ecdsa-p256:` (ECDSA P-256). |

**Signature computation**

The signature is computed over the canonical JSON of the TrustFrame with the `signature` field removed (keys sorted alphabetically, no whitespace) — same canonicalisation rule as IdentFrame in §5.1. Supported algorithms: Ed25519 (`ed25519:`) and ECDSA P-256 (`ecdsa-p256:`).

**Errors**

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-INVALID` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`) | TrustFrame is malformed (missing required field, signature verification fails, or canonical form is invalid). |
| `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-EXPIRED` (`NPS-AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED`) | Current time is past `expires_at`. |
| `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-GRANTOR-REVOKED` (`NPS-AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED`) | The `grantor_nid`'s own CA certificate is revoked or expired at verification time. |
| `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-SCOPE-EXCEEDS-GRANTOR` (`NPS-AUTH-FORBIDDEN`) | `trust_scope` contains a capability that the grantor itself does not hold (no-scope-expansion principle, §10.3). |
| `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-NODES-PATTERN-INVALID` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`) | An entry in `nodes` is not a syntactically valid `nwp://` URL pattern, or uses wildcards in a position where they are not permitted. |

### 5.3 RevokeFrame (0x22)

Revokes an NID, all certificates issued under an NID, or a specific certificate identified by serial. RevokeFrames are emitted by an issuing CA (or by an authorised operator under that CA) and pushed to subscribed Nodes via the NIP push channel; receivers update their local cert / OCSP cache and reject subsequent requests authenticated under the revoked target. A RevokeFrame is **fire-and-forget** at the protocol layer (no response frame on success); receivers MUST emit an `ErrorFrame` only when the frame itself is malformed or unauthorised.

**Field definitions**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `frame` | uint8 | required | Fixed value `0x22`. |
| `target_nid` | string (NID) | required | NID being revoked. MAY be an agent NID, node NID, group NID, or org NID. |
| `serial` | string (hex) | optional | Specific certificate serial under `target_nid` to revoke. If present, MUST match the serial of a currently-issued cert for `target_nid`. If omitted, ALL currently-issued certs for `target_nid` are revoked (effectively revoking the NID itself). |
| `reason` | string (enum) | required | One of the values defined in the reason table below. |
| `revoked_at` | string (ISO 8601 UTC) | required | Wall-clock instant at which revocation takes effect. Receivers SHOULD reject any request whose IdentFrame `issued_at` is at or before `revoked_at`. |
| `parent_nid` | string (NID) | conditional | REQUIRED when `reason = "parent_revoked"`; identifies the group NID whose cascade triggered this revocation (NPS-CR-0003). MUST be omitted for any other reason. |
| `signer_nid` | string (NID) | required | NID of the CA or operator signing this revocation. MUST be either the issuing CA of `target_nid`, an operator under that CA holding the `nip:revoke` capability, or — for cascade revocations — the CA that issued `parent_nid`. |
| `signature` | string | required | `{alg}:{base64url}` signature by `signer_nid`'s private key. Supported algorithms: `ed25519:` (Ed25519) or `ecdsa-p256:` (ECDSA P-256). |

**`reason` enum**

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `key_compromise` | Agent / node private key is known or suspected to be compromised. Highest urgency. |
| `ca_compromise` | The issuing CA's signing key is compromised; ALL certificates under that CA are implicitly revoked, and a per-NID RevokeFrame MAY be emitted for each affected child. |
| `affiliation_changed` | Agent left the issuing organisation; ALL of its capabilities are revoked even if individual certs have not yet expired. |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a re-issued certificate carrying the same NID (e.g. routine rotation that needs to invalidate the prior serial). The `serial` field SHOULD be set to identify the superseded cert. |
| `cessation_of_operation` | Agent / node has been decommissioned and will never present credentials again. |
| `parent_revoked` | (NPS-CR-0003) Cascade emitted by the CA on a session-NID whose group NID was revoked. The `parent_nid` field MUST be set to the group NID. Distinguishes ancestry-driven invalidation from a session revoked on its own merits. |

**Forward compatibility**: receivers encountering a `reason` value not present in the table above MUST treat it as `key_compromise` (the most restrictive interpretation). Receivers MAY additionally log the unknown value for diagnostic purposes and MAY emit `NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-REASON-UNKNOWN` to the publishing CA over a side channel, but MUST NOT silently demote an unknown reason to a less restrictive one.

**Signature computation**

The signature is computed over the canonical JSON of the RevokeFrame with the `signature` field removed (keys sorted alphabetically, no whitespace) — same canonicalisation rule as IdentFrame in §5.1 (RFC 8785 JCS).

**Errors**

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-INVALID` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`) | RevokeFrame is malformed (missing required field, signature verification fails, or canonical form is invalid). |
| `NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-UNAUTHORIZED-ISSUER` (`NPS-AUTH-FORBIDDEN`) | `signer_nid` is not authorised to revoke `target_nid` (not the issuing CA of `target_nid`, not an operator under that CA holding `nip:revoke`, and — for `parent_revoked` — not the CA that issued `parent_nid`). |
| `NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-SERIAL-MISMATCH` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-PARAM`) | `serial` is present but does not match any currently-issued cert for `target_nid`. |
| `NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-REASON-UNKNOWN` (`NPS-CLIENT-BAD-FRAME`) | `reason` carries a value outside the defined enum. Receivers treat the revocation as `key_compromise` for safety (see Forward compatibility above); this code is reported back to the publishing CA so the publish can be corrected. |

**Full example**

```json
{
  "frame":      "0x22",
  "target_nid": "urn:nps:agent:ca.innolotus.com:550e8400-e29b-41d4",
  "serial":     "0x0A3F9C",
  "reason":     "key_compromise",
  "revoked_at": "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z",
  "signer_nid": "urn:nps:org:ca.innolotus.com",
  "signature":  "ed25519:3045022100..."
}
```

**Cascade example (`parent_revoked`)**

```json
{
  "frame":      "0x22",
  "target_nid": "urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:session-1714672800-f3a92c0b",
  "reason":     "parent_revoked",
  "revoked_at": "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z",
  "parent_nid": "urn:nps:agent:ca.example.com:group-7f3c9e1a-b2d8-4c6f-9a01",
  "signer_nid": "urn:nps:org:ca.example.com",
  "signature":  "ed25519:..."
}
```

`parent_revoked` (NPS-CR-0003) is set by the CA on a session-NID `RevokeFrame` it emits as part of cascade revocation when the session's group NID was revoked. It distinguishes a session that was forcibly invalidated by ancestry from one revoked on its own merits.

```

### 6.1 Short-lived / renewable cert profile (edge mTLS)

Edge deployments that terminate native-mode mutual TLS at an `nps-ingress` (L2) gateway
(NPS-RFC-0006 §6.3) benefit from **short-lived certificates** to minimise revocation exposure
without per-request OCSP round-trips. This profile is additive to the standard validity tiers
(§2.1) and is selected by the CA at issuance.

| Property | Standard Node cert | **Short-lived edge cert** |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Validity | 90 days | **1–24 hours** (default 6 h) |
| Renewal trigger | 7 days pre-expiry | **renewal window = 25% of validity remaining** |
| Renewal overlap | both valid 1 h | both valid until the old cert's `expires_at` |
| Revocation reliance | OCSP / CRL | **lifetime ≤ OCSP cache TTL** — short validity is the primary revocation mechanism; OCSP is defense-in-depth |
| OCSP-staple interaction | optional | the gateway SHOULD staple (`IdentFrame.ocsp_staple`, NIP v0.9 §8.2); a stapled response older than the cert's remaining validity MUST be refreshed (`NIP-OCSP-STAPLE-EXPIRED`) |

Rules:

1. A short-lived edge cert MUST carry validity in `[1h, 24h]`. A request to issue outside this
   range returns `NIP-CA-SESSION-VALIDITY-INVALID` (reused from the session-NID path, §5).
2. The CA SHOULD support **online renewal** (ACME `agent-01`, NPS-RFC-0002) so an edge node
   self-renews before the renewal window without operator action.
3. A relying party (e.g. `nps-ingress`) MUST reject a presented short-lived cert whose
   `expires_at ≤ now` with `NIP-CERT-EXPIRED`; because validity is short, relying parties MAY
   skip per-request OCSP when the cert lifetime is ≤ their configured OCSP cache TTL.
4. Short-lived edge certs participate in TLS 1.3 session resumption (NPS-RFC-0006 §6.4): a
   resumption ticket MUST NOT outlive the certificate it was issued under.

---

## 7. Verification Flow

```
Node receives IdentFrame
  │
  ├─ 1. Check expires_at > now  (expired → NIP-CERT-EXPIRED)
  ├─ 2. Check issued_by is in NWM trusted_issuers  (not trusted → NIP-CERT-UNTRUSTED-ISSUER)
  ├─ 3. Verify signature with issued_by CA public key  (fail → NIP-CERT-SIGNATURE-INVALID)
  ├─ 3a. (NPS-CR-0003) If lineage.parent_nid is present, OCSP-lookup the parent
  │      (revoked or expired → NIP-CERT-PARENT-REVOKED)
  ├─ 4. OCSP lookup (when NWM configures ocsp_url) or local CRL check  (revoked → NIP-CERT-REVOKED)
  ├─ 5. Check capabilities contains what the node requires  (missing → NIP-CERT-CAPABILITY-MISSING)
  └─ 6. Check scope.nodes covers the target node path  (not covered → NWP-AUTH-NID-SCOPE-VIOLATION)
        All checks pass → authorize the request
```

Step **3a** (chain check) is mandatory whenever `lineage.parent_nid` is present, regardless of whether the session NID itself is still inside its own validity window. Combined with the CA-side cascade documented in §5.3 (`parent_revoked` reason), it provides defense-in-depth: a misconfigured CA that fails to record the cascade still gets caught at the verifier; a CA that did record it still publishes the entries to the CRL for simple consumers.

**Note on TrustFrame chains (§5.2)**: when the IdentFrame's `issued_by` is *not* in the Node's `trusted_issuers` directly, step 3 MAY still succeed via a TrustFrame chain. After step 3 (CA signature check), if the IdentFrame was issued by a `grantee_ca`, the Node SHOULD verify that a valid, unexpired TrustFrame exists from a matching `grantor_nid` (which IS in `trusted_issuers`) covering the requested capability and target node path. The TrustFrame itself MUST pass its own checks (§5.2 error table) — failure short-circuits admission with the corresponding `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-*` code instead of falling through to `NIP-CERT-UNTRUSTED-ISSUER`.

**Inbound RevokeFrame handling (§5.3)**: RevokeFrames arrive asynchronously over the NIP push channel and are not part of the per-IdentFrame admission flow above. When a Node receives a RevokeFrame it MUST:

```
Node receives RevokeFrame (push channel)
  │
  ├─ R1. Parse the frame and verify signer_nid signature over canonical JSON
  │      (fail → emit ErrorFrame NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-INVALID; do not apply)
  ├─ R2. Verify signer_nid is authorised to revoke target_nid — see §5.3 signer_nid rules
  │      (fail → emit ErrorFrame NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-UNAUTHORIZED-ISSUER; do not apply)
  ├─ R3. If `serial` is present, verify it matches a known issued cert for target_nid
  │      (mismatch → emit ErrorFrame NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-SERIAL-MISMATCH; do not apply)
  ├─ R4. If `reason` is outside the defined enum, treat as `key_compromise` (most restrictive)
  │      and emit ErrorFrame NIP-REVOKE-FRAME-REASON-UNKNOWN to the publisher
  ├─ R5. Poison the local cert / OCSP cache for target_nid
  │      (if `serial` present, scope to that cert; otherwise scope to all certs for target_nid)
  └─ R6. No success response is sent — RevokeFrame is fire-and-forget at the protocol layer.
```

After R5 takes effect, any subsequent IdentFrame for `target_nid` (or for the specific `serial` if scoped) will fail step 4 of the IdentFrame verification flow above with `NIP-CERT-REVOKED`.

### 8.1 Registration Authority (RA) endpoints (NPS-CR-0005, stub)

NPS-CR-0005 introduces a three-tier Registration Authority (RA) model that admits agents into the CA along policy-driven paths *in addition to* the Operator-credential `POST /v1/agents/register` flow above. The default tier remains `operator_only` — the new tiers are opt-in via `NipCaOptions.EnrollmentTier` and add the following endpoints:

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/v1/enrollment/tokens` | Operator Cert | (NPS-CR-0005, Tier 2) Mint a single-use, NID-scoped bootstrap token. |
| GET  | `/v1/enrollment/pending` | Operator Cert | (NPS-CR-0005, Tier 3) List registration requests awaiting admin decision. |
| POST | `/v1/enrollment/pending/{id}/approve` | Operator Cert | (NPS-CR-0005, Tier 3) Approve a pending request and issue the IdentFrame. |
| POST | `/v1/enrollment/pending/{id}/reject` | Operator Cert | (NPS-CR-0005, Tier 3) Reject a pending request with an operator-supplied reason. |

The three tiers (allowlist / bootstrap token / pending queue), the new error codes (`NIP-RA-TOKEN-INVALID`, `NIP-RA-TOKEN-EXPIRED`, `NIP-RA-NID-NOT-ALLOWED`, `NIP-RA-PENDING-REJECTED`), and the `NipCaOptions.EnrollmentTier` selector are specified in full by **[NPS-CR-0005](./cr/NPS-CR-0005-nip-ca-ra-model.md)**. The body, request/response shapes, and verification flow for these endpoints will land in this section once CR-0005 reaches Implemented.

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Key storage
CA private keys MUST be stored in an HSM or in an encrypted key file (AES-256-GCM). The OSS reference implementation uses encrypted files and reserves an HSM interface.

### 10.2 Timing-attack mitigation
OCSP response times SHOULD be normalized (fixed 200 ms delay) to prevent certificate-status inference via response-time side channels.

### 10.3 No-scope-expansion principle
At every link in the delegation chain, scope MUST NOT exceed that of its parent. CAs MUST enforce this at issuance time.

## 11. Change Log

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 0.10 | 2026-06-12 | New §6.1 **Short-lived / renewable cert profile (edge mTLS)**: 1–24 h validity tier (default 6 h) for native-mode mTLS terminated at `nps-ingress` (NPS-RFC-0006 §6.3); renewal window = 25% remaining; ACME `agent-01` online self-renewal; lifetime ≤ OCSP cache TTL so short validity is the primary revocation mechanism; OCSP-staple refresh interaction (`NIP-OCSP-STAPLE-EXPIRED`); resumption-ticket bounded to cert validity (NPS-RFC-0006 §6.4). Reuses existing error codes (`NIP-CA-SESSION-VALIDITY-INVALID`, `NIP-CERT-EXPIRED`); no new codes. |
| 0.10 | 2026-06-03 | `IdentFrame.node_roles` (`string[]`, optional) — self-declared role tags, same vocabulary as `NDP.AnnounceFrame.node_roles`; Phase 3 gate against `id-nps-node-roles` X.509 extension (OID 65715.2.2); `NIP-CERT-NODE-ROLES-MISMATCH` error code. |
| 0.9 | 2026-05-31 | `IdentFrame.ocsp_staple` (base64url DER OCSPResponse): §5.1.4 stapling rules (signature verify, `nextUpdate` check, `NIP-OCSP-STAPLE-EXPIRED`); X.509 OID table: `id-nid-assurance-level` 65715.2.1, `id-nps-node-roles` 65715.2.2, `id-nps-capabilities` 65715.2.3 (PEN 65715 — NPS-CR-0004). |
| 0.8 | 2026-05-11 | Expanded §5.2 TrustFrame: added full field definition table (10 fields, including new required `issued_at`, `serial`, and `signer_nid` for revocation/audit traceability), explicit signature-canonicalisation rule (matching §5.1 IdentFrame), error sub-table, and full example. Added TrustFrame verification note to §7 (admit IdentFrames whose `issued_by` is a `grantee_ca` when a valid TrustFrame from a trusted `grantor_nid` covers the request). Four new error codes (§9): `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-EXPIRED`, `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-GRANTOR-REVOKED`, `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-SCOPE-EXCEEDS-GRANTOR`, `NIP-TRUST-FRAME-NODES-PATTERN-INVALID`. |
| 0.7 | 2026-05-07 | **NPS-CR-0003**: Orchestrator group NIDs and short-lived session NIDs. New §3.1 reserves `group-` / `session-` identifier prefixes on `entity-type = agent`. New signed `IdentFrame.lineage` object with `role` / `parent_nid` / `group_nid` / `session_id` / `purpose` / `owner_user_id` / `owner_key_id` (§5.1.3). New revocation reason `parent_revoked` (§5.3). New verification step **3a** for chain-check (§7). Four new CA endpoints under `/v1/orchestrators/groups/...` (§8). Seven new error codes (§9): `NIP-CA-GROUP-REVOKED`, `NIP-CA-PARENT-NOT-FOUND`, `NIP-CA-PARENT-NOT-GROUP`, `NIP-CA-SESSION-VALIDITY-INVALID`, `NIP-CA-JWS-INVALID`, `NIP-CA-JWS-EXPIRED`, `NIP-CERT-PARENT-REVOKED`. Backward-compatible for ordinary single-NID flows; opt-in for orchestrators. |
| 0.6 | 2026-05-01 | Added `topology:read` to the standard `capabilities` registry (§5.1 capabilities table). This capability is required by Anchor Nodes at Phase 1–2 to gate access to topology read operations (`topology.snapshot` / `topology.stream`) as defined by the NPS-2 §12.4 minimum authorization binding (M6). Self-declared and key-signed at Phase 1–2; CA-attested role binding (`id-nps-node-roles` cert extension) deferred to Phase 3 pending RFC-0002 stabilization. |
| 0.5 | 2026-04-26 | Added §5.1.2 Reputation Log Entry — wire format for Certificate-Transparency-style append-only behavioral records about a `subject_nid`. Phase 1 ships the entry shape (12 fields including dual-signature requirements over JCS-canonicalised form), the initial 8-value `incident` enum (`cert-revoked` / `rate-limit-violation` / `tos-violation` / `scraping-pattern` / `payment-default` / `contract-dispute` / `impersonation-claim` / `positive-attestation`), and the 5-step `severity` enum. New error codes `NIP-REPUTATION-ENTRY-INVALID` and `NIP-REPUTATION-LOG-UNREACHABLE`. Merkle / STH / inclusion-proof surface deferred to Phase 2 per [NPS-RFC-0004](rfcs/NPS-RFC-0004-nid-reputation-log.md) §8.1. |
| 0.4 | 2026-04-25 | Added §5.1.1 Assurance Levels (`anonymous` / `attested` / `verified`); IdentFrame gains optional `assurance_level` field with backward-compatible default `anonymous`; new error codes `NIP-ASSURANCE-MISMATCH` and `NIP-ASSURANCE-UNKNOWN`. See [NPS-RFC-0003](rfcs/NPS-RFC-0003-agent-identity-assurance-levels.md). `Depends-On` NCP version corrected to `v0.6` per NPS-RFC-0001. |
| 0.2 | 2026-04-12 | Unified port 17433; added `metadata` field to IdentFrame (tokenizer auto-match); error codes switched to NPS-status-code mapping; error-code list completed |
| 0.1 | 2026-04-10 | Initial spec: NID format, IdentFrame/TrustFrame/RevokeFrame, CA Server API, verification flow |
